# Minimal bug reproduction project

This projects showcases the CORS error I'm getting when using the [@retroachievements/api](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/api-js) library

## Setup

Clone the project and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:5173?username=<username>&webApiKey=<webApiKey>` with whichever port Vite chooses. Don't forget to write your RA `username` and `webApiKy` in the query params
